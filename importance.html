        <div class="content-2">
          <h2>Gentrification in Seattle (2000s–Present)</h2>
          <p>As wealthier individuals moved into Seattle neighborhoods such as Capitol Hill and Central District, it displaced long-time residents, predominantly 
            people of color, increasing socioeconomic disparities and creating tensions. This shift has been linked to higher crime 
            rates in gentrified areas, as marginalized communities struggle with housing insecurity, rising costs of living, and a lack 
            of access to resources.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
  <div class="container-2 left-2">
    <div class="content-2">
      <h2>COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)</h2>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered societal disruptions, such as job losses 
        and mental health crises, contributing to higher assault crime rates. Crimes against people of color surged as a result of the pandemic
         and economic hardships amplified criminal behaviors in some Seattle communities</p>

  <div class="container-2 right-2">
    <div class="content-2">
      <h2>Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (2020)</h2>
      <p>The CHOP protest zone in Seattle following the BLM movement 
        created a temporary police-free environment, during which assault rates in the area spiked due to a lack of law enforcement presence. 
        This event highlighted the complexities of maintaining safety in protest zones and its potential effects on violent crime.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="container-2 left-2">
    <div class="content-2">
      <h2>Police Budget Cut (2020-2021)</h2>
      <p>The Seattle City Council cut its police department budget by nearly 17 percent in a shift that grew out of national protests against systemic racism. 
        These cuts may have contributed to a rise in violent crime, including assaults, due to the reduced presence of police in certain neighborhoods.</p>

  <div class="container-2 right-2">
    <div class="content-2">
      <h2>Drug Decriminalization Efforts (2021-2023)</h2>
      <p>Drug Decriminalization Efforts (2021-2023):</strong> Washington's decision to decriminalize 
        drugs resulted in the reclassification of drug possession as a public health issue. After negative reactions, In 2023, Seattle City Council decided, by a 6-3 vote, to make drug use and possession a gross misdemeanor under Seattle law.</p>

    <div class="content-2">
      <h2>Police Pursuit Law (2021-2024)</h2>
      <p>In 2021, Washington law prohibited officers from pursuing suspects without “probable cause”. In 2023, lawmakers lowered the 
        threshold for police to pursue a suspect from probable cause to reasonable suspicion for limited crimes including violent offenses.
        A 2024 initiative amends the controversial 2021 law by restoring the authority of a police officer to engage in a pursuit when there is reasonable suspicion a person has committed a crime.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Assault can leave victims with lasting trauma. Victims often experience a range of emotional and mental 
                health challenges, <strong>including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse.</strong></li> 
                <li>The psychological impact can extend beyond the immediate aftermath of the assault, affecting victims’ ability to

            <button class="accordion"><strong>Social Consequences</strong></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <ul>
            <li>Victims may find themselves ostracized, either due to the <strong>fear and mistrust in their communities.</strong> This isolation can prevent victims 
                from seeking help and accessing resources. 
                <li>People and communities, victims and witnesses may struggle to form 
                relationships, <strong>weakening the community structure further.</strong> This can result in a cycle of fear and violence, where individuals
